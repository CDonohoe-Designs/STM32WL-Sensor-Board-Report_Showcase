# STM32WL Sensor Board – Analog Front-End & LoRa System

This repository showcases a complete STM32WL-based sensor node design integrating analog front-end (AFE), ADC signal conditioning, and LoRa communication. It demonstrates a modular, simulation-backed hardware design suitable for real-time environmental monitoring and remote sensing applications.

---

## Project Overview

This project includes:
-  Low-noise analog front-end for signal acquisition
-  LoRa wireless communication using STM32WL
-  LTspice + Python simulation of filter and ADC behavior
-  Full schematic, PCB layout, and 3D render documentation
-  Designed with DFM/EMC in mind, for ISO/ETSI/FCC readiness
