# Simulation Folder

This folder contains analog simulation data supporting the STM32WL Sensor Board's analog front-end.

### ðŸ”§ Subfolders
- `LTspice/` â€“ SPICE simulations for analog filter, bias generation, and differential ADC drive.
- `Python Analysis/` â€“ Time-domain, frequency-domain, and SNR evaluation using NumPy/Matplotlib.

Simulations validate:
- Filter frequency response
- Time-domain ringing and pulse handling
- FFT noise attenuation
- Bias reference stability
