# Python-Based Filter Analysis

Python simulations provide time and frequency-domain evaluation of the analog filter design, including SNR effects.

### 🔍 Key Analysis Plots
- `TimeDomain_Sine.JPG` – 10 kHz sine wave response
- `TimeDomain_Pulse.JPG` – Step response (ringing and settling)
- `Python_SNR.JPG` – Filter effect on noisy signal SNR
- `Pyton_FFT.JPG` – FFT comparison of noisy input vs filtered output
- `PytonSallenKeyBode.JPG` – Filter magnitude & phase plot (log scale)

All plots generated using:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

These complement the LTspice results with scriptable, reproducible analysis.
