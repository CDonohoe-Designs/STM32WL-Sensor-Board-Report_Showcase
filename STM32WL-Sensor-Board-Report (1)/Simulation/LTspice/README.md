# LTspice Simulation Files

This folder includes all LTspice `.asc` and `.net` files used to simulate:

- ✅ 3rd-Order Sallen-Key Filter (Cutoff ~25 kHz)
- ✅ Bias Generator using Op-Amp for VCOM (1.65 V)
- ✅ Differential ADC signal drive using pseudo-differential structure

Useful for analyzing analog signal integrity before digitization.
